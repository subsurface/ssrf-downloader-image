<p>This will create an anonymized log that removes IP addresses, locations, and any aggregator keys and other secrets
  from your logs and upload them to a website for easier sharing with the developers.</p>
<p class="{% if url != '' %}d-none{% endif %}">After you click the button, this will display a link that you can share
  on one of the support forums (and that you can review first to make sure no personal data is included).</p>
<p class="{% if url == '' %}d-none{% endif %}">The link to the uploaded log is: <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>.</p>
<p class="{% if url == '' %}d-none{% endif %}">Please share this link with the developers who are trying to help you
  (and who most likely asked you to provide this info in the first place).</p>
